title: Getting Started With Django – Part 1
---

Django is a free open-source web framework, written in Python, It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an independent organization established as a non-profit.
Django’s primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. Django emphasizes reusabibilty and “pluggability” of components, rapid development, and the principle of DRY (Don’t repeat yourselt). Python is used throughout, even for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.
“Django started as an internal project at the Lawrence Journal-World newspaper in 2003. The web development team there often had to implement new features or even entire applications within hours. Therefore, Django was created to meet the fast deadlines of journalism websites, whilst at the same time keeping the development process clean and maintainable.”
